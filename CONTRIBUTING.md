# Contributing to AI Setup Sync

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This guide covers everything you need to get started.

## What this project is

This repo is the **AI Setup Sync** VS Code extension — it syncs shared AI setup files
(Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Google Antigravity 2.0, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, and more) from any GitHub repository you
own into your projects.

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `extension/` | The VS Code extension (TypeScript source, package.json, media) |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | CI — builds and publishes releases on `v*` tag pushes |

Pull requests are welcome for extension improvements, bug fixes, and documentation.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24+
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.85+
- `npm`

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/olekpuchka/ai-setup-sync.git
cd ai-setup-sync/extension
npm install
npm run compile
```

## Running the extension locally

1. Open the `extension/` folder in VS Code (or the repo root).
2. Press **F5** — this launches an **Extension Development Host** window with the extension loaded.
3. Open any folder in the dev host to trigger a sync.

Changes to TypeScript source require a recompile (`npm run compile` or `npm run watch`) and a reload of the dev host (**Ctrl+R** / **Cmd+R** in the dev host window).

## Key concepts

**Git blob SHA versioning** — instead of a manifest, the extension uses GitHub's git tree API which returns each file's blob SHA. The same SHA is computed locally (`blobSha.ts`) to detect changes without reading content.

**ETag/304 caching** — tree API requests include the previous ETag. A 304 response means nothing changed and doesn't count against GitHub's rate limit.

**Sync state** — per workspace folder in `context.globalState`. Stores the last-synced blob SHA for every tracked file (used to distinguish "unmodified since last sync" from "locally edited"), the tree ETag for 304 caching, and the full repository URL (`repoUrl`) to detect when the configured repo changes. Every file seen in a sync — including ones that were already up-to-date — is recorded so the restore path can detect local deletions.

**Branch** — `aiSetupSync.branch` (default `main`) is passed as `RepoRef.ref` to all GitHub API calls. Changing it affects which branch the tree and raw-file requests target.

**Path mappings** — `aiSetupSync.pathMappings` is a `Record<string, string>` that translates repo-relative source paths to workspace-relative destination paths at write time. Keys are matched longest-first so more specific paths always win. Trailing slashes are normalized on read. State is always keyed by repo path; disk I/O uses the mapped local path. Both the repo-side path (`validateRepoPath`) and the mapped local path (`validateLocalPath`) are checked for traversal sequences before any file I/O — this prevents a malicious workspace `.vscode/settings.json` from writing files outside the workspace root.

## Building a .vsix

```sh
cd extension
npm run vsce:package
# Output: /tmp/ai-setup-sync.vsix
```

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode.
- ES6+ — arrow functions, `const`/`let`, destructuring, template literals. No `var`.
- `const` by default; `let` only when reassignment is needed.
- No comments explaining *what* the code does — only *why* when the reason is non-obvious.
- No unused variables or imports.
- Run `npm run lint` (type-check) before submitting. There is no separate linter — TypeScript strict mode is the bar.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes. If modifying the extension, run `npm run lint` to confirm it type-checks clean.
3. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under a new version header (the maintainer assigns the version number).
4. Open a PR against `main`. Keep the title concise — it becomes the commit message on merge.

## Versioning and releases

Releases are built automatically by CI on `v*` tag pushes. The pipeline publishes to the VS Code Marketplace, extracts the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as release notes, and creates a GitHub Release. Only the maintainer cuts releases — you don't need to bump the version in your PR.
